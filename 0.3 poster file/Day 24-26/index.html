                <p>
                    Mitsuha Miyamizu, a high school girl, yearns to live the life of a boy in the bustling city of Tokyo—a dream that 
                    stands in stark contrast to her present life in the countryside. Meanwhile in the city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy 
                    life as a high school student while juggling his part-time job and hopes for a future in architecture.

                    One day, Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and suddenly finds herself living the dream life in 
                    Tokyo—but in Taki's body! Elsewhere, Taki finds himself living Mitsuha's life in the humble countryside. In 
                    pursuit of an answer to this strange phenomenon, they begin to search for one another.

                    on each other's lives, weaving them into a fabric held together by fate and circumstance.
